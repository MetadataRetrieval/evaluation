# Evaluation

This repository provides the TREC evaluation results for the [Befchina](https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.7.e67887) and [BioCADDIE](https://dx.doi.org/10.1093%2Fdatabase%2Fbax061) test collections


All metrics were computed with the latest [TREC scripts](https://trec.nist.gov/trec_eval/). For BioCADDIE in addition we computed the [inferred measures](https://trec.nist.gov/data/clinical/sample_eval.pl).

We also provide some metrics for object properties of selected ontologies which are used in the NLP pipelines for Entity Linking (see code repository). With a sparql query we obtained all object properties and numbers of entities using it in the respective ontology.
